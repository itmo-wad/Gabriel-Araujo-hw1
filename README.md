# Gabriel-Araujo-hw1

The page have 4 sections: a short description about me, some technologies that I'am familiar with, a short description of 3 of mine and my contact informations.

Implemented features:
1. Redirecting default route to '/profile'
2. Serving profile page template with render_template.
3. Using bootstrap to make the page more plesant and responsive.
4. Also using some icons from Font Awesome.

TODO:
1. Put the CSS in a separated file. It's currently inside the HTLM.
2. Remove all the style aplyied with style=""and create CSS classes to apply that styles. It's better for organization.
